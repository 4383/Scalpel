# Scalpel.

Static Anaysis for Python Programs
==================================
Scalpel is a Python module integrating classical program anaysis algorithms
with tailored features for Python language. It aims to provide simple and
efficient solutions to software engineering researchers that are accessible to
everybody and reusable in various contexts.
See xxx and xx for complete documentation and user guide.
