# Static Anaysis for Python Programs
## Introduction



Scalpel is a Python module integrating classical program anaysis algorithms
with tailored features for Python language. It aims to provide simple and
efficient solutions to software engineering researchers that are accessible to
everybody and reusable in various contexts.

### Setting up Scalpel
You can download the source code of Scalpel to install mannuly or use `pip` to install automatically.
```python
python setup.py
```
```shell
pip install scalpel
```
### Roadmap
As a general purpose framework, Scalpel is a layered structure and designed to support tasks at different granularity. You can know more from this user guide about different modules.

## Acknowledgement

We would like to express our gratitude to those poineers who worked on software engineering, static anaysis as well as  programming languages so that we can build this framework.
